1. Auto Repair Shop Website Prompt
Prompt:
Create a visually stunning, high-converting website design for an auto repair shop. Use Vite as the build tool for fast development and optimal performance.

Design Goals:

Hero section with a bold gradient background (deep navy blue → vibrant electric teal) and high-contrast, readable typography.

Modern, clean layout with soft rounded edges and generous white space.

Use subtle animations and hover effects on buttons and service icons for a premium feel.

Include high-quality images of mechanics at work and illustrated car icons fitting the brand style.

Call-to-action buttons should be bright orange, prominent, and encourage action (“Book Your Repair”, “Get a Free Estimate”).

Overall look: approachable, trustworthy, yet modern — perfect for local auto service businesses.

Sections to Include:

Hero section with headline (“Expert Auto Repairs You Can Trust”), tagline (“Keeping You on the Road Since 1995”), CTA button.

Service highlights with icons/images: Oil Change, Brake Repair, Engine Diagnostics, Tire Services.

Customer testimonials in card layout with friendly client photos.

Contact form + embedded Google Map showing the shop location.

Footer with key links (Services, About, Contact) and business info including hours and phone number.

Style & Inspiration:

Smooth gradient backgrounds with multi-stop gradients, not just two colors.

Minimal but elegant shadows and subtle glassmorphism effects behind cards.

Font pairing: Montserrat (bold, modern sans-serif) for headlines + Open Sans (friendly, clean sans-serif) for body text.

Color palette inspired by ocean blues and energetic orange accent for CTAs.

Extra Creative Touches:

Add subtle animated gradient blobs in the hero background that gently shift.

Mobile version keeps visual flair with stacked sections and simplified animations.
